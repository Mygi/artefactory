# The Research Diary



## Sunday October 25th 2020: On the hesitations that erode my willingness.

I think I need to start this diary being entirely clear and honest about where I stand right now.

Firstly, my foray into research has thus far been rather slapdash. I worked for an eResearch initiative, I attempted a MPhil and PhD but did not complete. I lead a Medical Education and technology Platform at a University, I did.a small side research project with Biomedical Engineering and I worked as a dialysis technician. I did work on a commercialisation project - based on significant research - but I spent less than a year there. So there is a culmination of effort without really ever going for it. 

Simply put, I never backed myself. I didn't have confidence in my ability to acheive what I wanted. Nor did I really spend enough time listenting to people who had gone before me. As a consequence, I gained knowledge but really, I have accomplished very little. That hurts a lot.

I think I have always hedged my bets - I couldn't commit myself to the full-time occupation of study at the sacrifice of income. Knowledge was never enough to forego those comforts or freedoms. Moreover, I have never realy thought of myself as a scientist. I love ideas - but I have always doubted my rigour and attention to detail to process an entire experiment. I squirm at the concept of defining a thesis to explore as opposed to a problem to solve. Even worse, my idea of extensive spending time in a lab depresses me and conflicts with my sheer joy of spending time outdoors in nature.

Yet having invested so much of myself to the study and practice of computer science as a profession - I have ended up in somewhat of a similar predicament. I like reading research. I like exploring ideas with models. I like the questions of why. Nonetheless - the lack of maturity in my understanding of scientific technique cannot be under sold. 

So here I find myself, seeing friends of mine present ideas and soluions to the world. As much as I am inspired by them - I'm a little jealous and also angry at myself for my ineptitude. My ideas were not lacking. What was lacking was my conviction.

Yet in that jealousy - lies a hidden truth. I want to be acknoweldged for my work. Moreover, I want to work on something that might actually make a difference to a lot of people in the world. Even if I am overwhlemed by what that actually means.

My self-impsoed hazard has been that I always attempt to over-think or over-complicate things. I do this becasue I think that the idea needs to be massive in order to solve a problem of such significance. Yet in describing a solution that is so enormous and complex - I quickjly become overwhlemed about how to make it happen I have little resources or time to invest in that big concept - that rolling the die and missing - well that might just be the failed Hail Mary - and the end of the ball game. 

However, oftentimes I cannot even solve the simple versions. For instance, a simple physilogical model of bathing - a practice mankind has endured for millenia - eludes me. Even though I can think very clearly about how to construct that model - I have not done it and nor do I understand the dynamics of the process. Even though, knowing this could well and truly benefit my life. So why do I hold myself back? Is my fear of failing so strong that I will not even venture to try. 

This is a long running dailogue in my head. Really the debate is no longer required. Yoda has this one on record. Do or do not - there is no try. 

The other hidden voice on the devil's shoulder - is that fear that I will be entirely bored by all of this. What adventure can be begot from such rational, calculated endeavour. Where is the bon vivante, here? That devil - she needs to pipe down over there because for all harsh words - we can but look where we are now and wonder what wisdom it has previously yielded.

The reality is that I have something to investigate. Something that matters deeply to who I am. Something that has meaning to other people beyond me. The only person parking the hand-brake is me; and as much as I would love to think that I'm drifting - in reality, I'm still stuck in the parking lot.

There we have it. We can only do one thing. Start.

### Rehashing

There is a compter science topic that I'm tempted by here but what I really mean is that I have been thinking about these ideas for nearly 15 years now - so it is probably about time I spilled my guts on to the paper. Otherwise, they will go stale in my head and I will not be free from them. So I should  descry all those Ideas - and get to a point of departure. 

This is our runway on a very slowly accelerating vehicle of flight.

#### Effective Hours

This concept is sitting with me today because - well, I'm not feeling great today. That uraemic feeling that feeling like viscous lethargy in my mind and my limbs - well that is that same feeling that eats up at my effectiveness. Where I feel so fatigured that progressing is challenging. This can be both a psychological and a physical lethargy. So I want to be able to caluclate how many hours per day I can be productive or effective. It stands to reason that  the better I manage my health, the more hours I get. To me that is the very essesnce of freedom from my condition - or at least achievement of my quality of life. Longevity is a nuisance metric - I would take more total effective hours instead. That is not overly complex a thing to achieve. ANy technology could satisfy it. What I really need is something that does not depend on my discipline to so. See - the insiduous thing about effective hours - is that I'm likely only going to record the good hours, since when I'm feeling tired or ineffective -I'm unlikely to fill out my chart. 

Nonetheless I like it as one of my metrics - so long as it is possible to record.

#### Excercise levels

SOmething I've found over time is that treating myself as an eltite athlete - will get me closer and closer to the nitty gritty of my condition. What performance can I get out of this body? There is so much I can explore by pushing myself.

Moreover, I have this dream of running a marathon. I also have a dream of riding my bike around the world (which would require a lot of technology). I don't just want to finish the marathon - I want to get some performance out of myself. There are so many challenges behind that but I like the science behind running - the cardiovascular and biomechanical points of inflection. I really like the measured approach to bike-riding and I think I can learn a lot about my cardiovascular capacity by pushing myself (somewhat gently). 

There is a specific run and bike ride approach that describes deltas in the benchmark measure and I suspect that imporvements in the benchmark would likely match to effective hours. I also suspect my pathological biochemstry would match.

**Pathology of high temproal value**

Blood tests every 3 months will tell m clinicians that I am stable but they won't tell me the underlying cause of my ineffectiveness or poor athlectic performance. There needs to be more feedback from the loop.

**Bathing, Swimming and Saunas**

This is looking like a prinicapl point of interest. It is minimally invasive, simple to measure and analyse and beneficial. How effective is it? We need to find out.

Moreover, it should be something we can model effectively. I f we cannot model bathing - how on earth could we model dialysis?

**Modelling**

Looks like computatonal models will be one of my points of attack.

**Cellular Potts Models**

I love this pattern and model. I want to use it on several ideas - so as to mature it. It will teach me a lot about handling threads, high performance computing and concurrency. Really exciting about exploring this.

**Travel, blogging and what not**

To make this fun - I think I need to document things. I also need to get oput my comfort zone. So we should add this to the equation. Right now, I'm really interested in water. So I should explore it.

**Oh that reminds me - water probably matters most**

So far - I've come to the conlcusions that where dialysis is concerned - water is the biggest issue. It needs to be ultra pure (I should explore the why of this later) and it really needs to be minimal in volume. The plumbing and provision of water in dialysis is technically the most challenging and financially the most expensive. It is also likely the most problematic and potential cause of inflammatory response outside of the toxin build-up itself. 

If you can get rid of the water - you make the system portable, affordable and sustainable. This is a no-brainer.

**Which is why the loop-of-henle matters so much**

No matter what - the function of the loop of henle and its ability to self-regulat a hyperosmotic solution - is the kidney's solution to portability. We could return to our water-bearing days and suvive in the sea for greater filtration - and the structure of the acquatic mammals kidney fascinates me greatly (hint: take a trip) - but no matter what if you can reliable replicate this function at minimal size - you can achieve so much more from dialysis.

**BUT: Re-generation is still the best solution**

So say you can model some of the structures of a kidney and say you can do that at a cellular level -- really what we need to be exploring is the potential for mast cells to regenerate and allow kidenys to self-heal. Even if we re-infuse our own pluripotent stemcells into specific topical locations in the kidney and perhaps make micro-incisions to allow for regeneration; if you can model at that level you give yourself a chance - not just for the ball game but possibly a world title.

**Does it really matter which molecules?**

Yes and no. You can modify your design to organise around specific molecules - but really that only matters if you are not feeling well or you are attempting to improve performance. Otherwise it is almost moot - especially when you start to investigate difficult to test light chain molecules and obscure middle sized poly-peptides. How on earth would you test your machine against such a complex specification? You need to be incremental.

**If I can salt and peper the market to create the reactions I want - how much is it worth**

I have a currency problem that I'm exploring with a Cellular Potts Model. What is fascinating is that you could model it to win - or you could model it based on how to best assert gradual influence so as to can the result you want. Both ideas are worth trillions - so long as you have millions to play with to begin with.
