# The Generalist

This is a sub-section of journal entries for items that do not fit into dialysis, research or coding. Probably the bulk of most of my thinking.

**Content Ideas**

So far we have some good ideas percolating on content:

1. Comparing end to end frameworks for building my blog and then other models - and hooking them altogether. I've been looking for a framework for a while. 
2. Investigation into what is photorealistic photography and how should I use photographs top provide an honest - warts and al portrayal of myself and my challenges with my condition. What art should be allowed. Perhaps surrealism will be more valuable? Need to communicate with many people such as professional / amateur photographers, medical photographers and scientific image analysis. A really good question - how would we perform pattern analysis on photographs - what should the baseline of honesty be - and how does this impact on AI?
3. I have been thinking about the idea of spritualism and renal failure. The idea that when I run long distance and sweat out - I seem to feel like I escape some dark spirit or phantom and my mind awakens from a cloud to see things very clearly. This is likely a toxin in my body - but I noticed similarities to Noragami - perhaps the combination of running and then bathing/swimming/sweating in spiritual water (some cleansing) and some sweat keeps the demons of toxicity out. This is by no means the blade the destroys/ablutes but it gives one the chance to find and cast that blade. Perhaps there is something in the spiritual journey of renal failure - and this may well be why I feel connection to indigineous australians with the same condition. Something is not balanced - between my energy and that of the land and it needs to be corrected.
4. So I have there established exercise goals to get me moving more - including 400,000 steps in November, 500,000 steps in Decemeber and 500km in January(!). These are very ambitious but I am thus far on track.
5. In addition to this I had the thought about my upcoming travels. In linking those two ideas, I thought I should take a local dialysis journey through Victoria - whereby I have to run or ride from one destination to the next. I think if I should do this, I should follow the spiritual journey of indigenous Victorians - which will require some help. I will need to plab dialysis centers along the way. Could be really fun way to start. Likely I'll need to follow the flow of water. I would love to do this witj Jenson over the summer holidays.
6. On top of this, my intent is to pursue similar journeys in Queensland, WA and the Northern Territory. There is a lot to understand.
7. I probably should wirte about learning Japanase - as a way to motivate me to do so. As that will be key to phase 2 of this journey.

This brings me to the challenge of what to do next. These blogs need to become more established in order to move forwards but I also need to stop bringing in the negative energy to the house. I think I should look for contract work - to give me more leverage for the next swing. As I'm basically planning to swing between high paying roles to get to the other side of the ravine - where I can explore the jungle independnetly and well-equipped. There needs to be some time lines for all of this but I think I am clear on what I need to get there.

I also need to decide how I'm going to present content. Video/ podcast / blog /images? I really want to create an animation as my ultimate goal. I could probably do that but I'll need to work on my capabailities. Digital Adventures was a really cool idea - by the way!

Ideas and things to work on:

* The idea of bathing has returned - this time with the creation of a custom solute of
  * Selenium
  * Magnesium
  * Zinc
  * Calcium
  * Iron
  * Sodium
  * Acidic Buffer (test with and without)
* Measure changes in the bath over time (especially easy measures like Urea)
* The next concept was that the T wave in the ECG should give a good hint at elevated potassium - a partial test for the watch
* Could extend this test with a pin-prick test - similar to glucose. Very handy continuous k+ solution.
* Already Pulse Oximetry / Temperature and BP measures across the limbs look really good as simple unobtrusive solutions
* Another good one is progressive uraemia by looking at yellow filters on the face.
* Also pH in various parts of the body (sweat / skin / blood / dialysis effluent) would be handy
* Finally contunous automated tests in the dialysis effluent would be especially useful.
* The combination of these measures with weight and some qualitative items could be really powerful... not sure if it would demonstrate chronic inflammation (may require full thermography) or immunodeficiency but we can only find out. Immunodeficiency is a really tricky idea in itself.
* That lead to the proposal of a non-dialysis day bath / sauana / ice-bath regime (hyperbaric chamber as well?) to see how it changes these results. Then you could propose a wearable of the same.
  * Where wearable - does it reduce the burden of the actual extracorporeal blood dialyser?
* Likewise a set of devices for commuincating and measuring all this information - then, how should the clinician identify these things in the mass of data.
* Two key points in this ongoing idea of potential transplantation. 
  * How long can you keep a kidney healthy out of the body. Why / Why not longer?
  * How could you make the body accommodate the kidney before transplantation - why does the mother-child in-utero relationsip work?
  * If a kidney could be stored outside the body - could you dialyse through it? 
  * Could yoi segement it - to make it last longer?
  * Could you potentially repair it?
  * This field would be exciting - perhaps the best solutions are actually here.
* When I put all these ideas together - I realised that a very good business idea would be the following:
  * Work on bringing reusable / fundamental software and hardware solutions to FDA readiness with insurances. Sell the licensing of those models and empower medics/researchers to build off existing tools. Lead the way on how to do this. 
  * Especially true as Machine Learning and Quantum Computing enter the fray
  * Even more important as software interactions with the brain start to take shape.
  * Need to pick your algorithms / hardware very well and get them to scratch.
  * Leverage an investment / insuarance model to cover your capital requirements.
  * An especially good idea for working with Dominic and Tomokon.
* Pulse Oximetry as a continuous measure - is already a military question. See here https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/182/suppl_1/92/4209394
  * Oximetry on the toe will identify peripheral vascular disease so yet abother valuable form,
  * Not sure if it would demonstrate inflammation



## Sunday 14th February 2021

A number of thoughts today:

1. Could you engineer a speicifc chipset that could ensure incredibly low power per coin cryptocurrency?
2. Would a cyrptocurrency be susceptible to to fully realised quantum computing?
3. What should the chipset that received data from the brain look like - so as to ensure safety, low heat and optimised signal processing?
4. Could you embed the analysis in hard/soft real-time of a number of concurrent measuring devices? Like oximetry, pulse, temp and pH?
5. Could I devise an organic computer that could solve something as complex as cyrpto-coin mining, Matrix solving of Fourier transforms? How small could I make it?
6. What would perpetual, sustainable computing look like? WHat is the minima of energy in for computation out - especially relevant for interstellar travel.
7. Could I perform velocimetry on a close to skin / blood device? What would it tell me? Could I use that for applying micro-needle assays?
8. Which set of problems would you take as most significant - in order to reduce them into solvable engineering problems so as to look for commonality?



## Sunday 7th March 2021

The first thought  of the ranks is to do with stress and possibly inflammation. This idea has been bouncing around for a while. I have this theory that my inconsistently low blood pressure has something to do with adrenal exhaustion. That my stress levels as related to the consumption of stimulants like caffeine, glucose and at times alcohol - are caused by a sypmathetic dominant nervous system. Upon exhausting said systm, there is minimal capacity to increase blood pressure. A secondary issue is likely to do with peripheral vascualr disease which also causes a limited ability to compress my vasculature and create pressure in a system. Finally, the massive flow rates exhibited in my fistula likely also contribute to unevenness in the dynamic of vasculay flow through my body. 

My suspicion is that my difficulty in losing weight is a complimentary issue to this stress concern. There is arbitrary evidence to support this thesis. For instance a process of stress release will often cause an improvement in my blood pressure regardless of my dry weight. Having relaxed for some time, caffeine will genuinely increase my blood pressure significantly upon consumption. 

Another symptom that might relate is the acidic taste I get in my mouth when I'm stressed (cortisol?). I seem to get this particularly when I have a sleep after being stressed - I wake up as if that acidity is starting to release. 

Further still, my digestive issues appear to have a strong correlation with stress. All in all, I would say that this combination of sympathetic dominance, stress and adrenal exhaustion combined with inflammation are the most pressing of all my health conditions and the one to address. 

The primary reason for leaving work was to give my body a chance to recover. 

Ideas currently in the works for improving on this position:

1. Invest in a home sauna to reduce stress and inflammation
2. Increase the number of baths taken per week - to achieve likewise
3. Stop working under duress
4. Cut back on coffee and glucose consumption (alcohol as well).
5. Maintain a far more regular/routine-based, healthy diet to prevent digestive problems and help with sleep.
6. Increase time on dialysis and reduce blood flow - allowing for less stress on my cadiocascualr system and more rest.
7. Reduce the size of the needle for dialysis - to allow for more frequent dialysis if needed.
8. Ensure Olive does not sleep with me on non-dialysis days.
9. Continue to exercise regularly and work towards improved V02 max and heart rate during standardised testing
10. Get an Exercise stress test and fistula gram.
11. Monitor blood pressure and weight more regularly (Especially against fluid in-take and weight)
12. Look into peripheral blood pressure and peripheral temperatures for indication of vascular inhibition. Could also check out pulse oxymmetry in distal limbs.
13. Ask dialysis team some questions on tracking and management - especially of atherosclerosis. Consider talking to a vascular surgeon.
14. Look for oxidative stress indicators to check.
15. Spend more time focusing on breathing and relaxation.



The next question is - what does forwards look like? Ideally the outcomes would be:

* Less cardio events like tachycardia (often during exercise after caffeine and a stressful day)
* Reduced weight
* Better blood pressure results before and after dialysis
* Better sleep (although somewhat subjective)
* Improved performance when exercising. Could have three standards for swimming, running and riding bike.
* Changes in blood results
* Other measures as necessary
* Less fatigue in eyes
* Improved quality and endurance of work per day - very subjective - but ideally what we want.
* Better skin



Importantly, what is our projected investment to achieve the desired outcomes. Arguably, there should be no expense spared but that would likely cause stress as well so this must be done in a sustainable way. You could argue for regular massage and spa teatments but this must be considered nice-to-haves. Perhaps these options can be added to the rewards list.

On the flip-side, the sauna may be an essential addition. 

A bug question would be about what the dialysis team recommend - especially for forms of measurement / pathology.

**The Final Word**

Until we can achieve some best-case scenario with the tools at hand, there is no reason to design a better dialysis machine. We have barely attempted a solution yet. It would be a good idea to track this online as well.

We need to formulate a solution this week and commence implementation. 

**Actions**

* Get tools for longer hour dialysis and reduced needle size (Wednesday meeting with Rosemary)
* Start measuring and recording data more frequently. 
  * Establish Baselines!
  * BP, Pulse and Weight - twice daily (pre meals and post all meals)
  * Running / Exercise statistics
  * Photos of Eyes - twice daily
  * Waist / Chest / hips / thighs / calves (Twice Weekly to cover variability - always post dialysis)
  * Monitor Sleep (happy / avergae / sad measures)
* Look into Sauna
* Propose regular diet.
  * Porridge with berries / Salad (breakfast 1)
  * Eggs with vegetables (alternative breakfast)
  * Coffee or Tumeric Tea
  * Fish or Seafood / Rice / Miso  / Vegetable Dish (Lunch 1)
  * Onigiri  (Alt Lunch)
  * Pomegranate or lemon/lime drink
  * Yoghurt with berries / passionfruit for dessert
  * Elegant Entrees (Dinner) - to challenge my cooking skills
    * Small grilled chicken salad
    * Beef Tataki or similar
    * Wonton Soup
    * Grilled Mushrooms
  * Treats
    * Brie with Crackers and Red Wine
    * Cookies
* Maintain regular strength work - exercise needs to become part of a schedule
* Start Measuring performance
  * 2 Laps of oval - time per lap vs average heart rates
  * 1Km swim - average speed per lap. Total time
  * 10km Bike ride (hard - need to operate without traffic lights)
  * V02 Max measures
  * Average Steps and distance.
* Set up website (Gatsby vs JAMStack?)
  * Explore pH, Regional Temperatures, distal BP and Pulse Oxymmetry if possible
  * Effluent Measures - requires a tank and a plan! Could also talk to BISU!
  * Look into a way to describe effective hours
